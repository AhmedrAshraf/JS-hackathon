            <h1>Why Does It Work?</h1>
            <p>Not all probiotics are the same. The overall biological action of a probiotic is not simply the sum of its individual components actions but the result of a complex network of relationships between the microorganisms it contains and the human host. Unlike many other products on the market, the clinical results obtained from CDS22-formula speak louder than any technical description.</p>
            <p>CDS22-formula combines 8 bacterial strains selected for their biochemical and enzymatic profiles and specifically calibrated in precise proportions to synergistically act on the physiology of the human gastrointestinal tract. It is crucial to emphasize that the production of the Formulazione De Simone falls within the field of biology, not chemistry, as the bacteria forming the product s base are living organisms. Their cultivation requires advanced scientific knowledge and specific know-how, still protected by industrial secrecy</p>
             <p>The unique and advanced know-how developed by Prof. Claudio De Simone, which includes specific industrial secrets, contributes to the uniqueness and efficacy of CDS22-formula, making it extremely difficult for others to replicate or produce an identical or functionally equivalent product. Supported by solid scientific evidence, CDS22-formula is highly effective in the dietary management of dysbiosis and other gastrointestinal conditions, offering proven and replicable clinical results.</p>

            <p >The De Simone Formulation contained in CDS22-formula is the result of pioneering research by Professor Claudio De Simone (MD, FAGA), who redefined therapeutic approaches to intestinal health by introducing the use of high concentration probiotic mixtures to dietetically manage acute and chronicgastrointestinal disorders.</p>
            <p>His interest in the intestinal microbiota dates back to the 1980s when the importance of the intestinal flora s role was just beginning to be understood. Professor De Simone is an honorary member of the American College of Gastroenterology and, after graduating in Medicine and Surgery, specialized in gastroenterology, allergology, and clinical immunology. He taught Infectious Diseases at the University of L’Aquila (Italy).</p>
            <p>Since the commercial launch of his renowned De Simone Formulation in the 1990s, the Professor has actively advocated for better regulation and quality control of probiotics, highlighting the potential health and well-being risks.</p>
            <p>As emphasized by Professor De Simone in numerous conferences and publications, many marketed probiotics have not been clinically tested or may not correspond to the original clinically tested formulations when marketed,</p>
            <p>Current regulations often do not require thorough comparative studies to ensure that changes in manufacturing processes do not compromise the efficacy and safety of the commercially distributed probiotic product.</p>

            <p >The lack of strict regulation and the possibility for manufacturers to modify formulations without adequately informing consumers pose a threat to public trust. In the past, the De Simone Formulation (DSF) was sold under the brand name VSL#3®*, by VSL Pharmaceuticals and Actial Srl.</p> <p>In 2019, VSL#3® distributors were found guilty of false advertising (for more information:Federal Judge Upholds $18M Verdict, Blocks False Advertising of VSL#3, Schulman Bhattacharya). Recently, the European Crohn s and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) has updated its guidelines to clarify that pre-2016 literature references to VSL#3® exclusively refer to DSF (ECCO, ECCO News, 2023). In 2024, ESPEN (European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism) published the article “Clarifying Correct Attributions in Scientific Literature: The Case of the De Simone Formulation and VSL#3®“, which reiterates the above.</p>
